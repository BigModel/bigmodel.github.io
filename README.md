# Project description
Hello, my name is Lucas, I'm Kenan's father, I dream of him being a model, but for financial reasons at the moment 
I can't go after it, because I work a lot, my wife and 
I work hard to provide the best for him, and that's why I believe that nfts can help us to make this dream come true. 
I am not an expert in creating websites or a good page in the jpg store, you can follow us on our networks, we are Brazilians from Santa Catarina. 
I hope many people can be profitable through this project, thank you very much for your attention and for trusting us!

Thank you!
